	abstract = {A new method to discretise Schrodinger equations on a mesh is described. This method is based on an accurate approximation of a variational calculation. The regularly spaced mesh and meshes based on the zeros of orthogonal polynomials are studied in detail. It is shown that with each type of mesh is associated a particular kinetic energy operator and an optimal formula for its discretized form. The applications to some simple potential problems show that the method is very accurate as well as very simple. Applications to many-body problems indicate that the accuracy of the results is improved by an order of magnitude with respect to conventional mesh calculations.},

the radial half-line, based on Bessel functions, are
presented. These are Hankel transforms of the
eigenfunctions of the particle in a spherical box in
k space, but there is no box or bound on the radial
variable r. The grid points extend to infinity on
the r axis. The DVR functions are exactly
orthonormal and exactly satisfy the interpolation
properties usually associated with DVR
functions. The exact matrix elements of the kinetic
energy are computed, and the use of the Bessel DVR
functions in radial eigenvalue problems is
illustrated. The phase space or semiclassical
interpretation of the Bessel DVR functions is
presented, and variations on these functions,
corresponding to alternative boundary conditions in
k space, are discussed. An interesting feature of
Bessel DVR functions is that they are based on a
finite basis representation that is continuously
infinite.},

This adds a second asymptotic expansion, with different scaling assumptions about the size of various terms in the problem, to achieve a minimum error much smaller than the best possible with the original asymptotic series. (This rescale-and-add process can be repeated further.) Weakly nonlocal solitary waves are used as an illustration.},

Our objective is to help young and also establiShed scientists and engineers to build the skills necessary to analyze equations that they encounter in their work. Our presentation is aimed at developing the insights and techniques that are most useful for attacking new problems. We do not emphasize special methods and tricks which work only for the classical transcendental functions; we do not dwell on equations whose exact solutions are known. The mathematical methods discussed in this book are known collectively as asymptotic and perturbative analysis. These are the most useful and powerful methods for finding approximate solutions to equations, but they are difficult to justify rigorously. Thus, we concentrate on the most fruitful aspect of applied analysis; namely, obtaining the answer. We stress care but not rigor. To explain our approach, we compare our goals with those of a freshman calculus course. A beginning calculus course is considered successful if the students have learned how to solve problems using calculus.},
