# Physics (iSciMath) 581: The Standard Model

## Learning Objectives

:::{margin}
In this course, the term "Standard Model" refers to the "Standard Model of Particle
Physics" in contradistinction to the "Standard Model of Cosmology" which includes the
components of inflation, the big bang, dark matter and dark energy (sometimes called
ΛCDM - for dark energy expressed as a cosmological constant "Λ" plus cold dark matter),
etc.

These two "Standard Models" are the most accurate and perplexing physical models we
have. They are perplexing in that we know they are wrong, but have no direct evidence
about how they breakdown.
:::
* **Dimensional Analysis**: All physical quantities are formed of four
  fundamental dimensions: **mass**, **time**, **distance**, and **charge**.  This
  affords a tremendously powerful technique called dimensional analysis that allows
  physicists to quickly estimate the form of an answer before doing any calculation.
  Dimensional analysis also allows one to check a calculation **or** to simplify a
  calculation by setting up to three independent quantities equal to unity.
  
  In discussions of the Standard Model, we often set $\hbar = c = 1$, thereby making
  equivalent energy, inverse time, and inverse length.

* Symmetries and


* Understand the ingredients and basic structure of the Standard Model, and how these
  come together to explain matter and its interactions.  This includes the following:
  * Quantum Field Theory (QFT) as the framework.
  * Fundamental space-time symmetries:
    * Relativistic Poincare invariance (Lorentz invariance + translations).
    * Non-relativistic limit of Galilean invariance (Rotations + boosts + translations).
    * CPT: Charge conjugation times parity times time-reversal invariance.  (Relates
      particles to anti-particles).
  * Representation of symmetries with groups.
  * Organization of matter in terms of spinors -- representations of the Poincare group.
    * Spin 0 fields (scalar bosons): the **Higgs** field.
    * Spin 1/2 fields (spinor fermions): **Electron**, **muon**, and **tauon**;
      Corresponding **Neutrinos**; **Quarks**.
    * Spin 1 fields (vector bosons): Mediators of force (interactions).  These vector
      bosons must be massless to avoid negative energies, and this ensured by imposing
      gauge symmetries  The following gauge bosons exist in the standard model:
      * $U(1)$: **Photon** (electromagnetic interactions)
      * $SU(2)$: **$W$ and $Z$ bosons** (weak interactions)
      * $SU(3)$: **Gluons** (strong interaction)

      *Note: The Higgs mechanism complicates the relationship betweem the bare gauge
      bosons that form the $SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge group of the standard
      model.*
    * Spin 2 fields: **Graviton**. Know that gravity fits within the framework of the
      Standard Model, but fails to be renormalizable (see below), rendering such a
      theory of gravity incomplete and lacks predictive power.
  * Principle of mass dimension and renormalizability.
* Understand how to combine these ingredients to form the Standard Model as the most
  general quantum field theory with these matter and gauge fields that satisfies all
  known symmetry constraints and includes only renormalizable terms.
* **QED**: Quantum electrodynamics consists of the QFT containing the electron and the
  photon.  Including atomic nuclei (made of protons and neutrons), this theory describes
  virtually all of the world we interact with daily, including most physical systems,
  chemistry, and biology.  This is the lowest energy scale of the Standard Model,
  dealing with atomic energies (eV to keV) and lengths scales on the order of
  angstroms (1Å=$10^{-10}$m) (think of the ground state of a Hydrogen atom etc.).
* **EW**: Adding to QED the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, as well as massive **mesons**
  (**pions**, **kaons**, and **tauons**) one obtains electroweak theory which includes
  phenomena such as radioactive decay: something we experience, but not on a daily basis
  (I hope!).  These occur at energies in the MeV range and lengths scales of picometers (1pm$=10^{-12}$m).
* **QCD**: Quantum chromodynamics includes the quarks and gluons as degrees of freedom.
  From these, we obtain the proton, neutron, and mesons included in the previous
  low-energy theories.  These interactions have energies of GeVs on the scale of a
  fermtometer (sometimes called a "fermi") 1fm$=10^{-15}$m.
* **Asymptotic Freedom**: QCD alone has another special feature -- the interactions
  become weaker and weaker as one goes to higher energy.  This means that as one probes
  with higher energies (equivalently, shorter length scales), the theory becomes
  non-interacting.  This introduces the tantalizing possibility that QCD is a correct
  theory "all the way down".  This is in contrast with QED, where the interactions get
  stronger at short distance, ultimately leading to a fundamental divergence (sometimes
  called the "Landau Pole") that tells us the theory cannot be complete mathematically.
* **Renormalization and Regularization:** From this description you see that the theory
  looks different at different energy scales.  This is the idea of renormalization


These ingredients and principles require many interesting and subtle mathematical
tools.  A good portion of this course will be devoted to explaining these tools, which
might have applications elsewhere.
