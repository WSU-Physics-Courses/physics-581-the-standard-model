JupyterBook Demonstration
=========================

This document demonstrates some of the features provided by the documentation.  It can
serve as a starting point for your own documentation.


This documentation is formatted using an extension to [Markdown] called [MyST] which
allows full interoperability with [Sphinx], the system used to build the documentation.
Here we demonstrate some features.  For more details, please see:

* [Jupyter Book]
* [Jupyter Book with Sphinx]
* [MyST Cheatsheet]

## Math

You can use LaTeX math with [MathJaX]:

### Example
Here we implement a simple example of a pendulum of mass $m$ hanging down distance $r$
from a pivot point in a gravitational field $g>0$ with coordinate $\theta$ so that the
mass is at $(x, z) = (r\sin\theta, -r\cos\theta)$ and $\theta=0$ is the downward
equilibrium position: 

\begin{gather*}
  L(\theta, \dot{\theta}, t) = \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + mgr\cos\theta\\
  p_{\theta} = \pdiff{L}{\dot{\theta}} = mr^2 \dot{\theta}, \qquad
  \dot{\theta}(\theta, p_{\theta}, t) = \frac{p_{\theta}}{mr^2},\\
  H(\theta, p_{\theta}) = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta} - L = \frac{p_{\theta}^2}{2mr^2} - mgr\cos\theta,\\
  \vect{y} = \begin{pmatrix}
    \theta\\
    p_{\theta}
  \end{pmatrix},\qquad
  \dot{\vect{y}} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    -1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \cdot
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \pdiff{H}{\theta}\\
    \pdiff{H}{p_{\theta}}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p_{\theta}/mr^2\\
    -mgr\sin\theta
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{gather*}

```{note}
On [CoCalc], only a subset of the math will render in the live Markdown editor.  This
uses [KaTeX], which is much faster than [MathJaX], but more limited.  The final
documentation will use [MathJaX], and loads the macros defined in
`Docs/_static/math_defs.tex`.

## Jupyter Notebooks

This document is actually a [Jupyter] notebook, synchronized with [Jupytext].  The top
of the document contains information about the kernel that should be used etc.  These
are parsed using [MyST-NB] and the output of cells will be displayed.  For example, here
is a plot demonstrating [Liouville's Theorem].

:::{sidebar} Phase flow for a pendulum.

The small colored circular region is evolved forward in
time according to the Hamiltonian equations.  The trajectories of 10 equally spaced
points are shown at 6 different times equally spaced from $t=0$ to $T =
2\pi\sqrt{r/g}$, the period of oscillation for small amplitude modes.  At small energies
(blue circle), the period is almost independent of the amplitude, and the circle stays
together.  As the energy increases (orange, green, and red), the period starts
to depend more sensitively on the amplitude, and the initial circular region starts to
shear.  The purple region divides the two qualitatively different regions of rotation
and libration, and gets stretched as some points oscillate and others orbit. 
The areas remain constant, despite this stretching, as a demonstration of
Liouville's theorem.

`````{admonition} Details
We start a code-block with:

````markdown
```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input, full-width]
...
```
````
This indicates that it is a code cell, to be run with python 3, and has some
[tags](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use/hiding.html) to make the cell and
output full width, but hiding the code.  (There is a link to click to show the code.)
`````

If you need more control, you can [glue] the output to a variable, then load it as a
proper figure, insert it in a table, etc.
